        <b>Answer : </b>
          <p><b style="color: darkslateblue;">Single Linked List</b></p>
        <p>Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has a link to its next element in the sequence 
        <p><b style="color: darkslateblue;">Operations Of Single Linked List</b></p>
        <p>1.Insertion: Insertion is used to add new node to the list. You can add at any specific position</p>
        <p>Example: Before Inserting 10 </p>
        <p>26->18->255->NULL
        <p>After Insertion </p>
        <p>5->10->26->18->55->NULL</p>
        <p>2.Deletion: Deletion is used to serve the existing node from the list </p>
        <p>Example: Delete 26</p>
        <p>5->10->18->55->NULL</p>
        <p>3.Traversal: Traversal visiting each node to display or process its data</p>
        <p>Example: Output:</p>
        <p> 5..10..18..55</p>
        <p>4. Searching: Searching is used to find a specific element in the list </p>
        <p>Search for 18--> Found</p>

<button class="collapsible"><b>Q2 :  List different hash functions used in hashing and explain any two of them with examples</b></button>
<div class="content">
<section class="cards">
<article class="card">
<b>Answer : </b>
<p><b style="color: darkslateblue;">HASH FUNCTION</b></p>
<p><ul><li> Hashing is the process of mapping large amounts of data item to a smaller table with the help of hashing function
</li><li> The Value Generated by Hash Function is called "Hash Value" which is used as an index to store values in the Hash Table</li></ul></p> 
<p><b> HASH FUNCTION </b></p>
<p><ul><li>Hash function is a function which maps key values to array indices OR Hash Function is a function which when applied to the key produces an integer which can be used as an address in a hash table <li>
  We will use h(k) for representing the hashing function Hash Values. The Values returned by a hash function are called hash values or hash codes or hash sums or simply hashs <p>
    For Example: Consider that we want to place some employee records in the hash table. The record of a employee is placed with the help of key: employee ID. The employee ID is a 7 digit number for placing the record in the Hash Table. To place the 
    record 7 digit number is converted into 3 digits by taking only last three digits of the key. If the key is 496700 it can be stored at 0th position. The second key 8421002, the record of those key is placeed at 2nd position in the array <p> Hence the hash function will be H(key)=key%1000 where key%1000 is a 
      hash function and key obtained by hash function is called hash key
    </p> 
  </p>
</li></li></ul></p>
<p><b> TYPES OF HASH FUNCTION</b></p>
<p> There are various types of hash function which are used to place the data in the hash tables</p>
<p>1.Divison Method </p>
<p> In this the hash function is dependent upon the remainder of a division </p>
<p>For Example: Table size is 5 keys are 10,18,24,26 then</p>
<p> H(10)=10%5=0--> this value is used as an index to store the value in the hash table</p>
<p> H(15)=18%5=3</p>
<p> H(24)=24%5=4</p>
<p> H(26)=26%5=1</p>
<p><b>2.Mid Square Method</b></p>
<p>In this method firstly key is squared and then mid part of the result is taken as the index. For
example: consider that if we want to place a record of 3101 and the size of table is 1000. So
31013101=9616201 ie. h (3101)= 162 (middle 3digit)</p>
<p><b>3.Digit Folding Method</b></p>
<p>In this method the key is divided into separate parts and by using some simple operations these parts
  are combined to produce a hash key. For example: consider a record of 12465512 then it will be 
  divided into parts i.e.124, 655, 12. After dividing the parts combine these parts by adding it 
</p>
<p>H(key)=124+655+12=791</p>
<p><b>Multiplication method</b></p>
<p>The given record is multiplied by some constant value. The formula for
computing the hash keyis
H(key) = floor (tablesize( key"A)%tablesize) )where p is integer constant, and A is constant real number</p>
<p><b> Donald Knuth suggested to use constant A=0.61803398987</b></p>
<p>fkey 23 and tablesize=10 then
H(key) = floor (10*(23*0.61803398987)% 10
= floor (142.14)% 10
= 142
At 142 locations in the hash table the record 23 will be placed</p>

<button class="collapsible"><b>Q3 : Define a Queue. Write algorithms for enqueue() and dequeue() operations and illustrate them with examples</b></button>
        <div class="content">
          <section class="cards">
            <article class="card">
            <p><b> QUEUES</b></p>
            <p><ul><li>Queue is a linear data structures where the first elements is inserted from one end called REAR and deleted from the other end called as FRONT
              <li>Front points to the begining of the queue and Rear points to the end of the queue</li> <li> Queue follows the FIFO (First In Fisrt Out) structure</li> 
              <li> According to its FIFO  structure,element inserted first will also be removed first</li> <li>
                In a queue, one end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the
otherisused to delete data (dequeue), because queue is open at both its ends
                </li> <li> The enqueue() and dequeue() are two importantfunctions used in a
queue.</li>
<p> <img src="images/queue.png" alt="Table"></p>
<p><b> enQueue(value)-Inserting an element into the Queue </b></p>
<p> We can use the following steps to insert a new nod into the queue</p>
<p><ul><li>STEP 1: Create a newNode with given value and set "newNode-->next" to NULL</li> <li>
  STEP 2: Check whether queue is is Empty(rear=NULL)
</li> <li> STEP 3: If it is Empty then,set front=newNode and rear=newNode</li> <li> STEP 4: If it is Not Empty then set rear->next=newNode and rear=newNode</li></ul></p>
<p><b> deQueue(value)-Deleting an Element from Queue </b></p>
<p>We can use the following steps todelete a node from the queue</p>
<p><ul><li>STEP 1:Check whether queueis Empty (front==NULL)</li> <li>STEP 2:If it is Empty, then display "Queue is Empty!! Deletion is not possible!!! and terminate from the function </li> <li>
  STEP 3: If it isNot Empty then, define a Node pointer'temp and set it to'front
</li> <li> STEP 4:Then set front =front next' and delete 'temp'(free(temp)).</li></ul></p>
<p><b>display()-Displaying the elements to Queue</b></p>
<p>We can use the following steps to display the elements (nodes) of a Queue</p>
<p><ul><li> STEP 1: Check whether queueis Empty (front == NULL).</li><li>STEP 2:-If it is Empty then, display 'Queueis Empty!!" and terminate thefunction.</li>
<li>STEP 3:-If itisNot Emptythen,define a Node pointer 'temp'andinitializewith front.</li> <li>
  STEP 4:- Display temp data --> and move it to the next node. Repeat the same
until 'temp' reaches to 'rear (tempnext I=NULL).
</li> <li>STEP 5-Finally! Display 'temp data->NULL.</li></ul></p>

        <div class="content">
          <section class="cards">
            <article class="card">
            <p> Binary Search Tree Deletion:</p>
            <p> 1. Delete the Function is used to delete the specified node from a binary search tree </p> 
            <p> 2. First we have to check with deleted node with root node if it is less than root node then we have to check left side of the
             tree if node to be deleted is greater than parent node we have to check right side of the tree 
            </p> 
            <p> 3.There are three situations of deleting a node from a binary search tree</p>
            <p><b>1.Node to be deleted is leaf node</b>
         </p>
         <p>It is the simplest case , in this case,replace the leaf node with the NULL and simple free the allocated space </p>
         <p>In the image we are deleting the node 85 since the node is a leaf node therefore the node will be replaced with NULL and allocated space will be freed
         </p>
         <p><img src="images/node85.png" alt="tree">
        </p>
        <p><b>2.The node to be deleted has only one child</b></p>
        <p>In this case replace the node with its child and delete the child node which now contaims the value which is to be deleted.Simply replace it with the NULL and free the allocated space .</p>
        <p>In the following image the node 12 is to be deleted it has only one child.The node will be replaced with its child node and the replaced node 12(which is now leaf node)will simply be deleted.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/node12.png" alt="tree"></p>
        <p><b>3. Node to be deleted has two childrens</b></p>
        <p>Node which has to deleted has two children then we can replace that node with </p>
        <p>a. In order predecessor </p>
        <p>b. In order successor </p>
        <p> <img src="images/node50.png" alt="tree"></p>
        <p>In the following image the node 50 is to be deleted which is the root node of the tree</p>
        <p>The in order traversal of the given tree below </p>
        <p> 6,25,30,50,52,60,70,75</p>
        <p> replace 50 with in its order successor 52.Now 50 will be moved to the leaf of the tree which will be simply deleted </p>
