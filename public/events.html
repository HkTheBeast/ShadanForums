    <p>C Programming Workshop Organized by NEXUS, Shadan College of Engineering and Technology

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shadan College of Engineering and Technology, under the student society NEXUS – Next-Gen Coders United Society, organized a C Programming Workshop for students from 2nd to 4th year. The workshop was conducted on 12th and 13th September, from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM, with a total duration of six hours, including a 45-minute break. The venue for the event was Computer Lab, Room No. 315, 2nd Floor.

The workshop was conducted free of cost, making it easily accessible to all students who were eager to enhance their programming skills. It was specially designed to introduce participants to the world of C programming, one of the most fundamental and widely used programming languages in computer science. Students were instructed to be ready with their personal computers or notebooks to practice and follow along with the sessions.

The key highlights of the workshop included practical learning, coding environment setup, project showcase, and a workshop toolkit that helped students apply their knowledge effectively. The sessions focused not only on theoretical understanding but also on real-time coding exercises, ensuring hands-on experience for all attendees. Participants got an opportunity to learn the basic structure of C programs, loops, functions, arrays, and many other programming concepts through live demonstrations and guided exercises.

Registration for the workshop was done prior to the event, and no spot entries were allowed. All registered candidates were notified via email, and entry passes were issued digitally. The workshop aimed to provide an interactive and engaging platform for students to strengthen their programming foundation and gain practical coding exposure.

The event was coordinated by Abdul Hadi, the student coordinator, and Dr. Imtiyaz Khan, the faculty coordinator, who ensured smooth organization and successful completion of the program. Their dedicated efforts, along with the enthusiastic participation of students, made the workshop a great success.

Overall, the C Programming Workshop by NEXUS proved to be an enriching experience for all participants. It provided a perfect blend of theoretical learning and practical implementation, encouraging students to explore programming with confidence. Events like these not only enhance technical knowledge but also inspire teamwork, innovation, and a passion for coding among students of Shadan College of Engineering and Technology.</p>
