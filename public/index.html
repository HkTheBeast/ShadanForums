          <h3>Shadan College Of Engineering</h3>
          <p>Established in 1995 under the aegis of the Shadan Educational Society, Shadan College of Engineering and Technology (SCET) in Hyderabad has grown steadily into a recognised institution for technical education in Telangana. 
 From its inception as the first minority-engineering college affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) in 1995, SCET has sought to combine rigorous academic programmes with hands-on learning. 
The college offers a broad range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in engineering and technologyâ€”spanning Civil, Mechanical, Electrical & Electronics, Electronics & Communication, Information Technology, Computer Science and more. 
 These disciplines are complemented by labs, workshops and infrastructure designed to support practical learning and innovation. Situated on Himayat Sagar Road, Peerancheru, the campus offers a focused environment for study, while maintaining connectivity with the city. 
SCET places strong emphasis on holistic development: along with technical competencies, it fosters student engagement through seminars, technical events and co-curricular activities. With over two decades of experience in engineering education, the institution continues to evolve its curriculum and facilities to meet industry demands. 
In summary, SCET is a well-established engineering college in Hyderabad that blends academic depth, practical training and a responsive learning environmentâ€”making it a solid choice for aspiring engineers seeking both foundational knowledge and real-world readiness.</p>
