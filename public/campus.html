<p>
	•	The infrastructure is clearly good, especially compared to many engineering colleges, but students’ reviews suggest “average in some respects” (e.g., food, some hostel systems) so it helps to visit campus.  ￼
	•	While many facilities exist, the quality and upkeep may differ across departments or hostels—so personal visit / peer feedback is valuable.
	•	Check for updates: Since facilities evolve (new labs, updated hostel amenities, etc.), always refer to the college’s official website or prospectus for the latest details.
	•	Factor in distance/travel time: Being a bit away from core city may increase commute time unless you use hostel/transport.
	•	For students with special needs, check hostel accessibility, transportation routes, and support services.
	•	Confirm costs: Hostel + mess + transport + other fees vary year to year; ensure you budget accordingly.</p><br>


<b style="color: crimson;">SUMMARY:</b>
<P>

In summary, SCET (Peerancheru) offers a solid and well-rounded infrastructure for engineering students: strong labs and IT infrastructure, good library resources, sports & fitness facilities, hostel accommodation, and transport. If you plan to attend, you would likely find a campus environment that supports academic and extra-curricular growth. However, as always with any institution, visiting the campus in person, talking to current students, and checking the latest condition of facilities will provide the best insight.</P><br>
