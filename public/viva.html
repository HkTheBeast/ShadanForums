<h2>OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING THROUGH JAVA :</h2><br>
<b>QUESTION:</b>
<p>1.What is Java?</p>
<p>ANS:   Java is an object-oriented, platform-independent programming language used to build applications.</p><br>
2.Who developed Java, and in which year?<br>
<p>ANS:  The four main features are:
PEncapsulation
,Abstraction
,Inheritance
,Polymorphism</p><br>
3.What are the main features of Java?<br>
<p>ANS:  Simple, Object-Oriented, Platform Independent, Secure, Robust, Portable, and Multithreaded</p><br>
4.What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?<br>
<p>ANS:  JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runs Java bytecode.</p>
<p>JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Contains JVM and libraries to run Java programs.</p>
<p>JDK (Java Development Kit): Contains JRE + tools to develop Java programs.</p><br>
5.What is bytecode?<br>
<p>ANS:  Bytecode is an intermediate code generated after compiling Java code. It is executed by JVM.</p><br>
6.Why is Java platform independent?<br>
<p>ANS:  Because Java programs are compiled into bytecode which can run on any system having JVM.</p><br>
7.What is the difference between Java and C++?<br>
<p>ANS:  Java is platform-independent and has no pointers; C++ is platform-dependent and supports pointers.</p><br>
8.What is a class and an object?<br>
<p>ANS:  Class: Blueprint or template of an object.</p>
<p>Object: Instance of a class.</p><br>
9.What is the difference between a constructor and a method?<br>
<p>ANS:  Constructor: Used to initialize an object; same name as class.</p>
<p>Method: Used to perform operations; can have any name.</p><br>
10.What is the use of the new keyword?<br>
<p>ANS:  It is used to create an object in Java.</p><br>
 
<h2>DATA STRUCTURE:</h2><br>
<p>QUESTION:</p><br>
<p>1.What is a data structure?</p>
<p>ANS:A data structure is a way to store and organize data efficiently for easy access and modification</p><br>
<p>2.Why are data structures important?</p>
<p>ANS:They help in managing large amounts of data efficiently and improve program performance.</p><br>
<p>3.What are the types of data structures?></p>
<p>ANS:Linear: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List</p>
<p> Tree, Graph</p><br>
<p>4.What is the difference between linear and non-linear data structures?</p>
<p>ANS:Dynamic memory allocation.</p>
<p>Easy insertion and deletion.</p><br>
<p>5.What is an array?</p>
<p>ANS:More memory due to pointers.</p>
<p>No random access to elements.</p><br>
<p>6.What are the advantages and disadvantages of arrays?</p>
<p> ANS:A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.</p><br>
<p>7.What is a pointer?</p>
<p>ANS:Push: Insert element.
Pop: Remove </p><br>
<p>8.What is a structure in C/C++?</p>
<p>ANS:Undo operation in text editors or the back button in a browser.</p><br>
<p>9.What is an algoritEnqueue: Insert element? </p>
<p>ANS:A queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle</p><br>
<p>10.What is the difference between stack  and queue?</p>
<p>ANS:Enqueue: Insert element at rear   Dequeue: Remove element from front.</p><br>

<h2> R LANGUAGE:</h2>
<p>1.What is R?<br>
<p> ANS:  R is an open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.</p><br>
2.Who developed R and when?<br>
<p>ANS: R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in 1993</p><br>
3.What are the main features of R?<br>
<P>ANS : Open-source, platform-independent, statistical analysis, graphics, data visualization, and extensible with packages.</p><br>
4.What is R used for?<br>
<p>ANS: Data analysis, statistical computing, data visualization, machine learning, and reporting.</p><br>
5.What is the difference between R and Python?<br>
<p>ANS: R is mainly for statistics and data analysis; Python is general-purpose and widely used in programming, web development, and data science.</p><br>
6.How do you install R and RStudio?<br>
<p>ANS:Install R from CRAN
Install RStudio IDE to write and run R scripts easily. </p><br>
7.What is CRAN?<br>
<p>ANS: CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is the official repository of R packages and source code</p><br>
8.What is the difference between R and RStudio?<br>
<p>ANS:R: Programming language and environment.
RStudio: IDE for writing and running R scripts</p><br>
9.What are vectors in R?<br>
<p>ANS: A vector is a one-dimensional array that holds elements of the same type (numeric, character, or logical).</p><br>
10.What are data types in R?</p>
<p>ANS:Numeric, Integer, Character, Logical, Factor, Complex, and Raw. </p><br>
