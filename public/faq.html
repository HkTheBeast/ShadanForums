                <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">Key Features of Java:</b></p>
                <p>Java is a popular, high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It provides several important features that make it powerful and widely used.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">1. Simple:</b></p>
                <p>Java is easy to learn and use because it removes complex features like pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">2. Object-Oriented:</b></p>
                <p>Everything in Java is treated as an object. It supports OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">3. Platform Independent:</b></p>
                <p>Java code can run on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) without modification, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">4. Secure:</b></p>
                <p>Java provides a secure environment through features like bytecode verification, sandboxing, and absence of explicit pointers.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">5. Robust:</b></p>
                <p>Java handles errors effectively with exception handling and has strong memory management using automatic garbage collection.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">6. Multithreaded:</b></p>
                <p>Java allows the execution of multiple threads (lightweight processes) simultaneously, improving performance.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">7. Portable:</b></p>
                <p>Java programs are portable because the same .class file can run anywhere a JVM is installed.</p>
                <p><b style="color: crimson;">8. High Performance (with JIT):</b></p>
                <p>The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler improves performance by converting bytecode into native machine code at runtime.</p>
