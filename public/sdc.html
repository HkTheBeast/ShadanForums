            <div class="answer-content"><b style="color: brown;">SOLUTION:</b>
            <p> What is Data? </p>
            <p>  Data refers to raw facts, statistics, or information collected or stored in a structured or unstructured form. Data 
can take various forms, such as text, numbers, images, videos, and more. It is the foundation of all information 
and knowledge and is used in various fields for analysis, decision-making, and understanding trends and patterns.</p>
<p> Data can be categorised into two main types</p>
<p> Structured Data: This type of data is organized into a specific format, such as tables or databases, and is 
easily searchable and analyzable. Examples include spreadsheets, relational databases, and CSV files. 
• Unstructured Data: Unstructured data lacks a specific format and can include text documents, social 
media posts, images, audio recordings, and more. Analyzing unstructured data often requires advanced 
techniques like natural language processing and image recognition.</p>
<p> Where to Find Data?</p>
<p> You can find data from various sources, depending on your specific needs: 
• Open Data Portals: Many governments and organizations provide free access to a wide range of data 
through open data portals. Examples include Data.gov (United States) and data.gov.uk (United Kingdom). 
• Data Repositories: Academic institutions, research organizations, and data enthusiasts often share 
datasets on platforms like Kaggle, GitHub, and the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
• APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Some websites and services offer APIs that allow you to 
programmatically access and retrieve data. Examples include Twitter API, Google Maps API, and 
financial market APIs. 
• Web Scraping: You can extract data from websites using web scraping tools and libraries like Beautiful Soup and 
Scrappy. However, be mindful of the website's terms of use and legal restrictions. 
• Surveys and Surveys: You can conduct your own surveys or collect data through questionnaires and interviews. 
• IoT Devices: Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate vast amounts of data that can be used for various purposes. 
• Commercial Data Providers: Some companies specialize in selling datasets for specific industries, such as market research,finance and healthcare </p>
<p> Foundation for Building Data visualisation:</p>
<p> • Data Analysis: Before creating visualizations, you should thoroughly analyze your data to understand its structure, 
relationships, and any patterns or trends. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques can help with this. 
• Statistical Knowledge: Understanding basic statistics is essential for making meaningful interpretations of data. 
Concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation are commonly used in data  visualization. 
• Domain Knowledge: Having knowledge of the specific domain or subject matter related to your data is crucial for 
creating contextually relevant visualizations. It helps you ask the right questions and provide valuable insights. 
• Visualization Tools: Familiarize yourself with data visualization tools and libraries such as mat plot lib, Sea born, 
ggplot2, D3.js, and Tableau. Each tool has its strengths and can be used for different types of visualizations. 
• Design Principles: Study design principles, including color theory, typography, and visual hierarchy, to create 
visually appealing and effective visualizations. Avoid common pitfalls like misleading visualizations. 
• Interactivity: Learn how to add interactive elements to your visualizations to engage users and allow them to 
explore the data. This can be achieved using tools like JavaScript, Python libraries, or dedicated visualization</p>
<p><img src="images/task 1.png" alt="ss"></p>
<p> Creating Your First Visualization:</p>
<p> To create your first data visualization, follow these general steps: 
 • Select Your Data: Choose a dataset that aligns with your goals and interests. Ensure that the data is clean 
 and well-structured. 
 • Define Your Objective: Clearly define what you want to communicate or explore with your visualization. 
 Are you looking to show trends, comparisons, or distributions? 
 • Choose the Right Visualization Type: Select a visualization type that suits your data and objectives. 
 Common types include bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts. 
 • Prepare and Transform Data: Preprocess your data as needed. This may involve aggregating, filtering,or transforming the data to fit the choosen visualisation.</p>
<p> • Create the  Visualization: Use a suitable tool or library to create your visualization. Customize it with 
 labels, colors, and other design elements. 
 • Interactivity (Optional): If appropriate, add interactive features to your visualization to allow users to 
 interact with the data. 
 • Test and Iterate: Review your visualization for accuracy and clarity. Seek feedback from others and make 
 improvements as necessary. 
 • Publish or Share: Once you are satisfied with your  visualization, publish it on a platform, embed it in a 
 report, or share it with your intended audience. 
 • Document and Explain: Provide context and explanations for your visualization. Clearly communicate 
 what the viewer should take away from it. 
 • Maintain and Update: If the data changes or new insights emerge, update your visualization accordingly.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <div class="answer-content"><b style="color: brown;">SOLUTION:</b>
              <p>Tableau offers a powerful set of calculation tools that allow you to manipulate, transform, and analyze your data 
in various ways. Here's an overview of some key concepts related to Tableau calculations, including SUM, AVG 
(average), and aggregate functions, as well as creating custom calculations and fields</p>
<p>SUM and AVG (Average) Functions</p>
<p><b style="color: brown;">SUM FUNCTION:</p>
  <p>The SUM function in Tableau calculates the total sum of a numeric field. You can use it to find the sum of values 
in a column or as part of a more complex calculation. To use SUM, simply drag and drop a numeric field into the 
"SUM" shelf, or you can create a calculated field using the SUM function.</p>

<p><b style="color: brown;">AVG (Average) Function:</p>
  <p>The AVG function calculates the average (mean) value of a numeric field. Like SUM, you can use it by dragging 
a numeric field into the "AVG" shelf or creating a calculated field with the AVG function.</p>

<p>Aggregate Functions: 
Tableau provides a range of aggregate functions that allow you to perform calculations on groups of data. 
Common aggregate functions include SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN (minimum value), and MAX (maximum value). 
These functions are particularly useful when you want to analyze data at different levels of granularity (e.g., by 
category, region, or time period).</p>

<p>Creating Custom Calculations 
Tableau allows you to create custom calculations using calculated fields. Here's how to create a custom 
calculation:</p>
<p><b style="color: brown;">1.Create a new Calculated Field</p>
  <p>In the Data Source Pane, right-click on your data source and select "Create Calculated Field".</p>
  <p><img src="" alt=""></p>
  <p>Alternatively, you can create a calculated field by right-clicking on a shelf in your worksheet and choosing "Create 
Calculated Field". </p>
<p><b style="color: brown;">2.Enter your calculation:</p>
  <p>In the calculated field editor, you can use functions, operators, and field references to define your calculation. 
For example, you can create a calculated field to calculate profit margin as (SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])) * 100.</p>
  <p><b style="color: brown;">3.Name and save the Calculated field:</p>
  <p>Give your calculated field a meaningful name. </p>
  <p>Click the "OK" or "Apply" button to save the calculated field.</p>
  
  <p>Alternatively, you can create a calculated field by right-clicking on a shelf in your worksheet and choosing "Create 
Calculated Field". </p>
<p><b style="color: brown;">4. Use the Calculated Field in Your Worksheet:</p>
  <p>You can now use the calculated field like any other field in your worksheet. Drag it to the Rows or Columns shelf, 
use it in filters, or create visualizations based on it.</p>
